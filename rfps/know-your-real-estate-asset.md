## Project Description :page_facing_up: 

//Please describe exactly why you are proposing this RFP. 

//Make sure to point out why itâ€™s potentially useful for your project or other projects in the ecosystem.  

**Introduction**
In a business and investment world of rapid digitization, decentralization and frequent lack of regulation and oversight, fraud is a sophisticated, enduring and intrusive threat.

A single act of investment fraud perpetrated on an investor on the
Polymath Capital Platform (PCP) could have long-term, 
devastating consequences for the PCP and it's ability to attract asset issuers and investors.

The purpose of the Know Your Real-estate Asset project is to reduce the potential of fraud 
as much as possible in order to protect the integrity of the PCP and the interests of its investors in RE STOs.

Note: On one hand, we have limited the scope of this project to fraud prevention for 
real-estate backed STOs (RE STOs) only.
On the other hand, we presume that the approach
taken here will apply equally well to non-RE STOs, with some adjustments.
Our thinking is to focus on the single problem of RE STO fraud prevention and achieve it,
rather than the universal problem of fraud prevention, and later apply it to other types of STOs.

While real estate fraud in the physical or digital world cannot be prevented entirely, 
it is REtokens' position 
that the threat of fraud can be greatly reduced by increasing the veracity of RE STOs documentation
traditional documentation made available via the PCP.

And while there are different types of RE STO fraud a perpetrator could commit, 
the scope of this project is limited to preventing issuance of a RE STO:

- with non-existent backing property
- with a backing property which is not 'owned' by the issuer

**Objectives**

The objectives of this project are:

- to define which documents best serve guaranteeing RE STO veracity.

- to make it simple and cost-effective for issuers to demonstrate RE STO veracity.

- to ensure potential investors can perform due diligence on the veracity of the backing property easily and with confidence

- to define and implement a technical process for storing or referencing documentation from the PCP in a manner which guarantees documentation integrity via hashing and issuer non-repudiation via digital signature.

**Impact**

The impact of this project will be to make it easier for potential investors to recognize RE STOs which are fraudulent as related to their existence or ownership.

The ultimate effect will be to discourage and prevent issuance of fraudulent RE STOs in the first place.

**Expected Outcomes**

An outcome of this project is enabling 
potential investors to access conclusive RE STO 
due diligence documentation fast and with confidence 
directly or indirectly from the blockchain. 
This can accelerate word-of-mouth promotion which will drive network effect adoption.

This storage, as well, of other due diligence 
documents and/or references on-chain will greatly 
dematerialize the due diligence process in other areas, 
such as valuation.
